# Shoe Classification

## Overview
This project is focused on the image classification of shoes, utilizing various deep learning techniques. Models employed include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and two pre-trained models: VGG16 and RESNET50.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 13,000 images of shoes and is hosted on Kaggle. You can access and download the dataset here:
- [Shoes Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/shoes-classification-dataset-13k-images?resource=download)

## Models Used
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** A fundamental deep learning model for image processing tasks.
- **VGG16 Pretrained Model:** A deep convolutional network developed and trained by the Visual Graphics Group at Oxford, known for its effectiveness in image recognition.
- **RESNET50 Pretrained Model:** A residual learning framework to provide deeper insights into neural networks, enabling the training of deeper models by introducing residual blocks.
